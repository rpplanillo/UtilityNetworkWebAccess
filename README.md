# Utility Network Web Access testing

Utility network web access using web services. Tests. 

Some examples of raw consumption (no API below yet) of utility network functionality exposed through web services.

I use this repository to learn how to interact with the ArcGIS utility network and to understand future challenges in developing functionality over the web.

Hope they help you too in your exploration... :)
